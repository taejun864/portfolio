This is SKPACK's homepage.

The project consisted of three people, and I was in charge of front-end and back-end development.

This is the first project consisted with three people, with a designer joining the team of two people, the PM, who was in charge of design and code review from previous projects, and me, who was the sub-leader and mainly wrote code.

## Application

It consists of a homepage screen viewed by general users and an admin page where administrators can manage the content of the homepage (add, edit, or delete content).
The ngx-admin template was used for the admin page.

Back-end also written in **TypeScript**, and developed as Restful API used **NestJS** framework. 
The DBMS used was **MySQL**, and **TypeORM** was used for DB connection and object mapping in **TypeScript**.

The developed application was serviced as a **Docker** container and was transferred to **AWS EKS**.
